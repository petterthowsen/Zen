# Zen

Zen is a high level programming language implemented in C#. The interpreter is currently a tree walk interpreter and follows the Crafting Interpreters book.

# About Zen

Zen is a high-level programming language inspired by modern languages such as C#, Java, Go, Python, Ruby, PHP, Node JS and others.

At a glance, Zen
- Has simple syntax.
- Strict typing with type inference.
- Functions and closures as first-class citizens.
- Runs in a single-threaded event loop similar to Node JS and supports async/await as syntactic sugar over promises.
- Fully cross platform across Windows, Mac and Linux.
- C and C# Interop

## Installing

Binaries for windows, mac & linux will be made available when Zen is more mature or upon request. It's pretty easy to build it yourself - all you need is dotnet with SDK 8.0 or later.


## Building and Running

To build and run the project:

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the project
dotnet run --project src/Zen

# to build and run, a helper script 'zen.sh' exists which will drop you in a Zen REPL.
./zen.sh
```

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage (optional)
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

## Development

The project uses:
- C# 12 features
- .NET 8.0
- XUnit for testing

To add new tests, create test files in the `tests/Zen.Tests` directory following the naming convention `*Tests.cs`.

## Project File Organization

- Each project (src/Zen and tests/Zen.Tests) follows standard .NET conventions:
  - Source code files are in the project root or organized in subdirectories
  - `bin` directory contains compiled outputs (excluded from git)
  - `obj` directory contains intermediate build files (excluded from git)


Note: Each project directory (src/Zen and tests/Zen.Tests) contains its own `bin` and `obj` directories for build outputs. These are automatically generated by .NET and are excluded from source control via .gitignore.
