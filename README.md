# Zen Language

A programming language implementation in C#.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later

## Project Structure

```
zenlang/
├── src/
│   └── Zen/           # Main project
│       ├── Lexing/    # Lexer implementation
│       └── Program.cs # Entry point
├── tests/
│   └── Zen.Tests/     # Test project
└── .gitignore         # Git ignore file for build outputs
```

Note: Each project directory (src/Zen and tests/Zen.Tests) contains its own `bin` and `obj` directories for build outputs. These are automatically generated by .NET and are excluded from source control via .gitignore.

## Building and Running

To build and run the project:

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the project
dotnet run --project src/Zen
```

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage (optional)
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

## Development

The project uses:
- C# 12 features
- .NET 8.0
- XUnit for testing

To add new tests, create test files in the `tests/Zen.Tests` directory following the naming convention `*Tests.cs`.

## Project Organization

- Each project (src/Zen and tests/Zen.Tests) follows standard .NET conventions:
  - Source code files are in the project root or organized in subdirectories
  - `bin` directory contains compiled outputs (excluded from git)
  - `obj` directory contains intermediate build files (excluded from git)
