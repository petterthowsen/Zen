# Zen

Zen is a high level programming language implemented in C#.

The back end implementation is currently a tree walk interpreter and as such, is relatively slow compared to alternatives. However, Zen is more than fast enough fo many tasks, including web apps, 2D game development and other projects.

# About Zen

Zen is a high-level programming language inspired by modern languages such as C#, Java, Go, Python, Ruby, PHP, Node JS and others.

It's aim is to be:

- Simple yet powerful
- Supports both very strict typing and looser/dynamic typing
- Targeted towards general-purpose use cases, but with some special attention to Web Development
- Fully cross platform across Windows, Mac and Linux

Syntactically, Zen aims to strike a balance between ease of use and verboseness; between readability and customizability; between simplicity and complexity.

The Zen Runtime runs in an event loop on a single thread - similar to Node JS, and supports 'async' and 'await' for asynchronous programming.

Features include:
- OOP: classes, interfaces, objects, inheritence
- Concurrency: await/async for asynchronous programming
- Anonymous functions and callbacks
- Event system as a language feature
- Testing system as a langauge feature with assert statements


## Installing

Binaries for windows, mac & linux will be made available when Zen is more mature or upon request. It's pretty easy to build it yourself - all you need is dotnet with SDK 8.0 or later.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later

## Project Structure

```
zenlang/
├── src/
│   └── Zen/           # Main project
│       ├── Lexing/    # Lexer implementation
│       └── Program.cs # Entry point
├── tests/
│   └── Zen.Tests/     # Test project
└── .gitignore         # Git ignore file for build outputs
```

Note: Each project directory (src/Zen and tests/Zen.Tests) contains its own `bin` and `obj` directories for build outputs. These are automatically generated by .NET and are excluded from source control via .gitignore.

## Building and Running

To build and run the project:

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the project
dotnet run --project src/Zen

# to build and run, a helper script 'zen.sh' exists which will drop you in a Zen REPL.
./zen.sh
```

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage (optional)
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

## Development

The project uses:
- C# 12 features
- .NET 8.0
- XUnit for testing

To add new tests, create test files in the `tests/Zen.Tests` directory following the naming convention `*Tests.cs`.

## Project Organization

- Each project (src/Zen and tests/Zen.Tests) follows standard .NET conventions:
  - Source code files are in the project root or organized in subdirectories
  - `bin` directory contains compiled outputs (excluded from git)
  - `obj` directory contains intermediate build files (excluded from git)
